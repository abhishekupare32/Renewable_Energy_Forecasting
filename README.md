## Project Overview
Forecast India’s renewable energy consumption using historical data. Includes:
- Data Cleaning & EDA
- Correlation analysis
- Forecasting with Prophet
- Visualizations

## Dataset
`renewable_energy_consumption.csv` contains solar, wind, hydro, biofuel, and total renewable consumption from 2010-2020.

## How to Run
1. Open `Renewable_Energy_Forecasting_India.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.  
2. Ensure `renewable_energy_consumption.csv` is in the same folder.  
3. Run all cells to generate EDA and forecast visualizations.  

## Insights
- India’s renewable energy consumption has grown rapidly after 2010.  
- Wind and solar energy contributions are increasing faster than hydro.  
- Forecast predicts steady growth over the next decade.
